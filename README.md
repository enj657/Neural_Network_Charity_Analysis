# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

I received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup. I need to use the features in the dataset to create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether apllicants will be successful or not if they are funded by Alphabet Soup, using my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks. I will preprocess the data for a neural network model, train/evaluate the model, and try to optimize the model.

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to design a binary classifier that is capable of predicting if applicants will be successful with funding from Alphabet Soup.
